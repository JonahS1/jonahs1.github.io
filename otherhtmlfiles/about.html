                        The High Technology High School Performing Arts Club 
                        (HTHS PAC) is one of the largest and most popular clubs 
                        at High Tech. A student-run club, PAC puts on two shows 
                        each year, the fall play and the spring musical. Each of 
                        these shows has tons of opportunities for students to get 
                        involved. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Audition information is emailed out to students on the 
                        mailing list and is posted under the Auditions section of 
                        the site. Anyone interested in acting, singing, or dancing 
                        in the productions is encouraged to try out. Even if you 
                        don’t have any experience, come try out! PAC is the perfect 
                        place to try your hand at performing arts, whether it’s in 
                        a show or at improv meetings.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In addition, PAC forms a band every year that plays during 
                        the intermission of the fall show. For the musical, the 
                        band plays the songs to accompany the actors, singers, and 
                        dancers. No audition is needed to join the band, and all 
                        instruments are welcome! 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Not interested in performing? There are still many ways to 
                        get involved. The stage crew, for instance, builds all the 
                        sets and props for all the productions, a fantastic 
                        opportunity for those who have a passion for visual art. 
                        They also work behind the scenes to help the show move 
                        smoothly by facilitating set changes and keeping track of 
                        props. The tech crew runs the sound and lighting for all 
                        the shows. We also recruit people to help choose and create 
                        costumes, as well as to do hair and makeup for the performers.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Whatever your passion, you’re sure to find your place at 
                        PAC. PAC is a fantastic way to make new friends and 
                        unforgettably fun memories.
